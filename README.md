You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# How to run the R scipt

-It's better to put all the data sets together in one single folder and set the directory to that folder
-There are some codes like *head*ï¼Œ*names* may not be useful in this assignment. I just use them to debug or find some information.
